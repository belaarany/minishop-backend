# Minishop backend

Microservice-based webshop backend.

## ðŸš€ Tech stack
- RabbitMQ
- SAGA Choreography pattern
- Microservice apps in NodeJS, PHP, Python and Java

## ðŸŽ¯ Motivation
I created this project to dive into the microservice patterns and RabbitMQ best practices. The goal was to implement a webshop backend with only mock functionality and in-memory databases, focusing on the SAGA Choreography pattern and RabbitMQ configurations in different programming languages.

## Test
### Payment
| card number | result
| -- | --
| `3232323232323232` | Payment will be failed immediately
| `4242424242424242` | Payment will be failed with 3 second delay
| `5252525252525252` | Payment will succeed with 3 second delay
| _Any other card number_ | Payment will succeed immediately
